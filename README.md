# Interactive Visualization Dashboard
Northwestern University Data Science Boot Camp

Homework 15

In this project, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). I utilized the D3 and Plotly.js libraries to display this dashboard on a webpage. The page includes a dropdown menu to select which individual you would like inspect. Then, the page will update a demographics info table, bar chart, and bubble chart to match that individual's belly button sample results.
